## 3D Printing Files

You’ll need to 3D print the following parts to build the Training Village system. We provide the raw 3d models in STL files, and also the all of them arranged in a single 3mf. For easy replacement, we also provide the 3mf files of some subsets of parts. The 3mf files have the optimal orientation for accuracy and the supports needed (the parts don’t need supports unless mentioned).
The 3mf files were generated with Bambu studio, we recommend it to open them.

The full print requires an estimate of 1.1kg of generic pla filament and about a day and three hours to print.
