## Calibrate and Test Corridor Components

In the 'MONITOR' Screen:

1. **Set Door Motor Angles**: Select the `CORRIDOR` actions and use the `CHANGE MOTOR` ANGLES button to correctly set the opening and closing angles for each door. The closing angle should allow the door to gently touch the top without pushing further.
2. **Calibrate the Scale**: Use the `CALIBRATE SCALE` button with a known weight to calibrate the scale, and verify functionality by pressing `GET WEIGHT`.
3. **Check Temperature and Humidity**: Use the `GET TEMPERATURE` button to check temperature and humidity readings.
