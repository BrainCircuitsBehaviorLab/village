## List of Parts

Below are the detailed lists of what you'll need to print, purchase, and assemble.

### 3D-Printed Parts

You'll need to 3D print the following parts to build the Mouse Village system. Make sure
to use the provided STL files in the **original orientation** for accuracy (the
parts **don't need supports** unless mentioned):

- **Corridor Lower parts**
  - Tunnel components
  - Door mechanisms
  - Enclosures for the electronics

- **Corridor Upper parts**
  - Tunnel components

- **Cage connectors**
  - Tunnel components
  - Door mechanisms
  - Enclosures for the electronics

### CNC Machined Parts

Below are the CAD files for the parts that need to be CNC machined:

- **Transparent Acrylic Components**:
  - **Corridor Lid**: The lid that covers the corridor.
  - **Corridor Lid Stops**: These stops ensure that the mice cannot push up the corridor
  lid and escape the system.

- **White Acrylic Components**:
  - **Base**: The foundation where the Mouse Village is mounted.
  - **Doors**: CNC machined doors for the system.
  - **Blockers**: These blockers are used during maintenance to keep the mice inside the
  system without needing to handle them. They fit into a slot on each cage connector,
  preventing the mice from exiting when the tubes are disconnected.


### Aluminium Extrusions and Tubes

For the structural support and frame of the Mouse Village system, you will need
aluminium extrusions and tubes. These provide durability and stability to the entire
setup. Below is a basic list of what you'll need:

- **Aluminium Extrusions**:
  - 20x20 mm extrusions (for the chamber frame)
  - 30x30 mm extrusions (for heavier support sections)
- **Tubes**:
  - Aluminium tubes (for connecting various components and ensuring rigidity)

Make sure to source these parts from reliable suppliers to ensure quality and fit.

Feel free to follow the instructions in the
[Assembly Instructions Section][Assembly Instructions]
for detailed guidance on how to assemble the Training Village system.



### Electronic Components

Hereâ€™s the list of all the electronic components you will need to purchase:

- **Sensors**:
  - RFID reader
  - Infrared beams for position detection
- **Motors**:
  - Motorized doors (for mouse sorting and chamber access)
- **Microcontrollers**:
  - Arduino (for controlling sorting and automation)
- **Other Components**:
  - Water reward pump
  - Piezoelectric buzzer
  - IR camera for monitoring
  - Power supply and cables
