The Training Village is a system designed for the continuous automated training of rodents in complex cognitive tasks. In the system, RFID-tagged animals live in groups and access individually the behavioral box (e.g. an operant chamber) to perform tasks at any time, rain or shine. The Training Village is  designed to wrap around your  own task protocols and integrate with your behavioral control system although we provide it in tandem with a general-purpose touchscreen chamber and some standard task protocols run by BPoD (by [Sanworks][SANWORKS]).
The system monitors the animals through two camerasâ€”one in the entry corridor and another inside the behavioral box. Remote access is available at any time to check on the system's status. Additionally, a configurable alert system integrated with Telegram allows users to receive real-time notifications regarding system conditions.  The Training Village is freely available, and legally protected by [GPL version 3][GPL] and [OSHW version 1][OSHW] licenses.
