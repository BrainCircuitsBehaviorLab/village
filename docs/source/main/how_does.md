## How Does It Work?

The system is composed of several key components: the housing where the animals live, the behavioral box where tasks are performed, and the corridor that regulates access to the behavioral box.

**The Housing:** The animals live together in one or more cages, which promotes better welfare. Any type of cage can be used, as long as it is connected to the corridor via a tube. We offer a solution with 2 or 4 cages connected by transparent acrylic tubes, which can serve different purposes (e.g., one cage with food, another for resting). Optionally, RFID sensors can be installed in the corridors connecting the cages (ECOHAB(link)) to gather more data on the animalsâ€™ social behavior.

**The Behavioral Box:** Any type of behavioral box can be used. We provide two design options: one with auditory stimuli and three behavioral ports, and another with a touchscreen and one port. The system is designed to interact with behavioral boxes controlled by Bpod (using Python). Integration with other controllers, such as Bcontrol or Bonsai, is currently under development.
