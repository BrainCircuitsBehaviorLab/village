## The Corridor

This is the central part of the system, consisting of a plastic corridor equipped with an RFID sensor, a weight scale, and a camera. Using a mechanism with two doors, animals can enter the behavioral box under certain conditions. The entire system is controlled by a Raspberry Pi, which handles sending and receiving signals from electronic devices, controls the cameras, and runs the software that controls the whole system.
Most of the elements in the mouse version of the corridor are 3D-printed, except for the doors and the corridor lid, which are made of white laser-cut acrylic. The design files are shared in the How to build the training village (link) section. We also share the rat version, which includes more laser-cut parts and fewer printed components due to its larger size and the increased strength required.
