## System Usage

The Training Village has been rigorously tested in the [Brain Circuits and Behavioral Lab][LAB] with different groups of mice and two different behavioral tasks: a multi-choice delayed response task and a foraging task. Recently, the system has been adapted to rats in the [Animal Minds Lab][RAT].

The Training Village can work continuously for months, allowing the automatic collection of large datasets of cognitive-demanding tasks that often require long training periods (e.g. 20-40 sessions). It automatically adjusts training difficulty, timing, and session duration based on each animalâ€™s motivation and needs,  letting subjects learn at their own pace while ensuring a balanced usage of the behavioral box. On average, mice in the Training Village perform about three sessions per day, with a significant preference for the nighttime. Behavioral box occupancy depends on the group size. With groups of 14 animals housed together in the system, the average occupancy is around 70% of the total daytime (i.e. 16.8 hours of training per day), indicating a high usage at this capacity. Subjects' performance and motivation are comparable to the manual training, yet with a significant reduction in the experimenter involvement.
