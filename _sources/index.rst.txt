Mouse Village is a system designed for the automated training of rodents. It allows animals to live in the system 24/7 and access a behavioral box to perform tasks at any time, day or night. Users can either design their own training protocols or use one of the available ones (e.g., 2AFC).
The system monitors the animals through two camerasâ€”one in the entry corridor and another inside the behavioral box. Remote access is available at any time to check on the system's status. Additionally, a configurable alert system integrated with Telegram allows users to receive real-time notifications regarding system conditions.
