## Hardware Connections

Once the system is set up for remote access, disconnect the keyboard, mouse, and monitor, and place the Raspberry Pi in its designated position in the corridor. Connect the two servo motors, the RFID reader, and the temperature sensor. Connect the two cameras as well. Also, connect the Bpod (or other behavioral controller) to the bottom USB port closest to the Raspberry Piâ€™s Ethernet port.
