## Maintenance
This is a routine to maintain proper functioning and hygiene in the TV system.

**Daily:**
Check [telegram alarms][ALARMS] and resolve any issues. Review daily reports to monitor animals' progression in training.

**Weekly:**
Clean the operant box and corridor. Clean and refill sucrose water in the operant box.

**Biweekly:**
Replace citric acid bottles. Change home-cages and enrichment, ensure sufficient food is available.

**Occasionally:**
Deliver water manually to a specific mouse (as required). Calibrate water delivery system (once every two months or if suspected malfunction occurs). Clean lickports and remove dust from water ports (once every two months). Deep-clean the touchscreen, including removal of the mask (once every four months).

> **Notes on cleaning:** Before cleaning, check whether the operant box is occupied. If occupied, stop the task manually and use the automatic buttons to remove the animal. Block the corridor with a lid. After cleaning, verify that all electronic components in the operant box and corridor are functioning properly.
