First, ensure that the corridor is assembled. Follow these [instructions][INSTRUCTIONS] to complete the assembly. If you prefer to build it yourself, [here][PLANS] you will find the plans for all the pieces as well as a list of all necessary electronic components.

The Raspberry Pi includes an SD card that contains both the operating system (Raspberry Pi OS) and all the required software pre-installed. Before placing the Raspberry Pi in its designated space in the corridor, you only need to configure it for remote access.

If you are using your own Raspberry Pi, click [here][SOFTWARE] for the software installation instructions.
