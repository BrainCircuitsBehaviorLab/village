If you have purchased a Training Village from us, you will receive all the necessary parts for assembly, which requires only a screwdriver. Assembly is straightforward and can be easily completed by following these [instructions][INSTRUCTIONS].

We provide the Raspberry Pi along with an SD card that contains both the operating system (Raspberry Pi OS) and all required software pre-installed.

Once assembled, simply insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi, and you can proceed with the system [configuration][CONFIGURE], including setting up remote access over the internet and backups.

After that, refer to the [user guide][GUIDE] to learn how to implant the animals with RFID capsules and how to operate the system effectively.

If you prefer to build the Training Village yourself, start by checking the complete list of required parts and the plans for all 3D-printable pieces [here][PLANS]. Once you have your own Raspberry Pi, you can either [download][ISO] an image of the SD card to copy onto your device or [install everything from scratch][SOFTWARE].
