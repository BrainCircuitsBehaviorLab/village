## List of Parts

Below are the detailed lists of what you'll need to print, purchase, and assemble. The estimated cost for all the system is 4300â‚¬.

### 3D-Printed Parts

You'll need to 3D print the following parts to build the Training Village system.

- **Corridor parts**
  - Bottom parts (home, central and cage)
  - Top parts (home, central and cage)
  - RFID parts 1 and 2

- **Other parts**
  - Door system mounts (left and right)
  - Camera mount (top and bottom)
  - Cable organizer (top and bottom)

- **Cage connectors**
  - Tunnel connectors (x6)
  - Cage connectors (x7)

### CNC Machined Parts

Below are the CAD files for the parts that need to be CNC machined:

- **Transparent Acrylic 4mm Components**:
  - **Corridor Lid** (x1): The lid that covers the corridor.
  - **Corridor Lid Stops** (x3): These stops ensure that the mice cannot push up the corridor
  lid and escape the system.

- **White Acrylic 3mm Components**:
  - **Base** (x1): The foundation where the Training Village is mounted. There are 2 versions, small base that uses 2 homecages, and large base that uses 4 homecages.
  - **Doors** (x2): CNC machined doors for the system.
  - **Blockers** (x7): These blockers are used during maintenance to keep the mice inside the
  system without needing to handle them. They fit into a slot on each cage connector,
  preventing the mice from exiting when the tubes are disconnected.

### Aluminium Extrusions and Tubes

For the structural support and frame of the Mouse Village system, you will need
aluminium extrusions and tubes. These provide durability and stability to the entire
setup. Below is a basic list of what you'll need:

- **Aluminium Extrusions**:
  - 20x20 mm extrusions (for the chamber frame)
  - 30x30 mm extrusions (for heavier support sections)
- **Tubes**:
  - Aluminium tubes (for connecting various components and ensuring rigidity)

Make sure to source these parts from reliable suppliers to ensure quality and fit.
